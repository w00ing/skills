# grill-with-docs

`grill-with-docs` is a Codex skill for stress-testing a plan against the language, boundaries, and decisions already present in a codebase.

It asks one focused question at a time, checks the repository when the answer should be discoverable from code or docs, and captures settled domain language in `CONTEXT.md`. It can also suggest ADRs when a decision is hard to reverse, surprising without context, and shaped by a real trade-off.

This version is packaged as a standalone skill. It includes its own context and ADR formats, so it does not rely on other skills being installed.
